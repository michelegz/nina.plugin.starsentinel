[assembly: AssemblyMetadata("LongDescription", @"StarSentinel is a N.I.N.A. plugin that monitors the number of detected stars in saved light frames and helps protect imaging sessions from degrading sky conditions.

It provides a Loop Condition for the Advanced Sequencer. The plugin keeps a history of recent star counts, calculates the 80th-percentile value as a reference, and evaluates each new frame against both a relative threshold and an absolute star-count threshold.

A frame is considered bad when the relative star count falls below the configured percentile threshold or when the raw star count is below the configured absolute limit. After a configurable number of consecutive bad frames, the loop condition is set to false and the sequence can stop.

The analysis ignores non-light frames and resets its history automatically when the imaging context changes (filter, exposure, binning, gain, sensor type, or significant field-of-view shift), so the condition adapts to new targets and exposures.

This plugin is intended as a lightweight safeguard based on image data rather than external sky sensors. It is heuristic by design: star count can be influenced by focus, filters, target density, and seeing conditions, so use it with appropriate thresholds for your setup.")]
